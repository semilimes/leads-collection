## üîé What do you get

### Hosting options

You can choose to download this recipe and self-host it in any node-red environment. For a hassle-free approach, you can use the [semilimes Services](https://my.semilimes.net) to fully manage your recipe directly in a cloud-based environment. Choose the option that best fits for you.

### Adaptive data collection form

This recipe comes with a standard set of data requested to the people during events/exhibitions:

```
- First Name
- Last Name
- Company
- Site/Role
- Email
- Phone
- Technical Reference
- Interests list
- Lead type list
- Business Card pictures
- Other pictures
- Description
- Follow-up list
```

Specifically for the lists, you can change the preset options that the users will choose, according to your business type and network.

### Real-time record processing

On each interaction on the proposed data collection form, the data will be instantaneously processed and saved in the internal storage, to ensure you don't lose any precious information.

### Unlimited form sharing 

Anyone within your sales and technical teams (and more!) can join in using this workflow. The published form can be shared with all the team members to parallelize the collection process from each team member's phone.

### Review organized information

By using the integrated dashboard, anyone responsible for the data review and registration can quickly access all the collected data, review them, save the raw data and perform further processing in the company systems.

### Free solution

You can use it as it is, tweak or extend it as much as you like. Everything is under your control!

## üìΩÔ∏è How does it work

Once the solution is run under your subaccount, the following happens...

### Leads Form Channel Creation

A new `Leads Form` channel will be automatically created. This form will be populated with the actual data collection form that you have configured in this recipe.

This is the channel that you can share with your team, so that everyone will be able to use the form and collect data.

### Leads Results Channel Creation

The `Leads Results` channel will be created to collect all the collected information directly in-app. This channel should NOT be shared as it is meant to be a service container and to be used for a quick review of the submitted info by the other users.

### Dashboard Creation

A Node-RED dashboard page will be created in your environment, and this is meant to be the place where to review the collected data.

Depending on your hosting choice, this page is directly reachable from your node-red instance in the cloud or on your on-premise system.

In the configuration section you will find out how to setup semilimes to access it directly from your mobile/web app.
